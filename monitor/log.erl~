%%% @doc multi purpose log utility module
%%% Does prcoessing of filters, matching the conditions and doing the
%%% actions.
%% The filters are sent to session by monitor
%% All monitors have a copy of filters
%% When Filters are modified all monitors need to be updated
%% There are three kinds of fields in the filter
%% 1) client, server, proto and port - these can be simply matched against
%% the syn packet
%% 2) latencies - these can be matched by session during the session
%%% 3) average and peak latencies - These can be matched by admin during 
%%% session_update. In this case there is no need to log the session traffic
%%%  as this session
%%% is just the last straw and the root cause

%%% This is not a process
%%% This code runs in the context of session processes
